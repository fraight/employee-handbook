## 3. Dating Policy

Fraight strongly believes that an environment where employees understand the boundaries between personal and business interactions is most effective for conducting business, specifically for individuals in supervisory relationships or other influential roles. Although this policy does not prevent the development of friendships (we encourage them!) or romantic relationships between coworkers, it does establish clear boundaries for individuals in supervisory relationships.

Employee off-duty conduct is regarded as private as long as such conduct does not create problems within the workplace. An exception to this principle, however, is romantic or sexual relationships between supervisors/managers and their direct reports and anyone under their organizational influence. Supervisors/managers cannot be in romantic or intimate relationships with those under their organizational influence and any inappropriate behavior between supervisors/managers and their reports will result in immediate remedy, including possible termination.

Supervisors, managers, executives or anyone else in sensitive or influential positions must disclose to Human Resources  the existence of any relationship with another coworker that has progressed beyond a platonic friendship. This disclosure will enable Fraight to determine whether any conflict of interest exists because of the relative positions of the individuals involved. Where problems or potential risks are Fraight identified, Fraight will work with the parties involved to consider options for resolving the problem.
