# Glossary

As we know, language is hard. So is management. But that doesn't keep us
from trying!

Here are some frameworks we've borrowed to discuss priorit

*Disagree and Commit*
Decisions are hard. We cannot be afraid to make bad choices, and someone
needs to make the call. We do not always need complete agreement, but we always
do need to support each other.
Origin: Amazon

*Alignment and Autonomy*
Our management goal. Let's get on the same page,

*#idea, #suggestion, #mandate*
When dealing with a manager sometimes it's confusing if you are being
instructed to do something. Manager can clarify, you can ask for clarification.
Manager can clarify with:
 - #idea - I am just throwing this at the wall
 - #suggestion - My gut says you should do this, but you own it
 - #mandate -
Origin: Twitter?

*80/20 rule*
What: The Pareto Principle: 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort,
the last 20% of the results take 80% of the effort.

*Management Quadrants // Q1, Q2*
How to prioritize what to do next
Q1 - urgent & important; do it fast, clear it out
Q2 - not-urgent & important; this is where the magic happens
Origin: Eisenhower

| Not Urgent    | Urgent        |      |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| -------------:|
| *Q2* Live Here | *Q1* Do this fast | Important     |
| X      | Delegate         | Not Important |

*Draw the Owl*
> There are two steps in drawing an owl.
> First, you draw a circle for the head, and a circle for the body
> Then, you draw the fucking owl.

Origin: Startups

*Sharpen the Axe*
> "Give me 6 hours to cut down a tree, and I'll spend the first four sharpening the axe" - Abraham Lincoln

Long term thinking, planning.
Sometime it feels good to just start swinging, but it's important to remember
we're in this for the long haul.

## FraightChat

Here's nonsense that's caught on

*200* -
What: Short for "Ok, I got it."
Origin: 200 http response code = "success"
How:

*Cycle*
What: Short for "Cycle Request"
How:
```
You: "Cycle"
Them: "Queued - give me 5",  "What's up?", or "Denied"
```
Why: If someone is focused it, disruptions can really set them back. Even letting them know
what you want to talk about can break someone's "flow".
Origin: Processors.
