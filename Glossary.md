# Glossary

Here are some frameworks we've borrowed. They are all approximations,
none of them apply everywhere, and some even conflict.

As we know, language is hard. So is management. So are decisions.

But that doesn't keep us from trying!

##### Tradeoffs

[Decisions are hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVp8UGjECt4)

##### Decision Scoring: Great // Good // Bad // Blunder
In chess scoring, there is no such thing** as a "perfect" move. Calculating
the entire decision tree is just not a realistic strategy.

Our goal is to optimize good/great moves, minimize bad moves, and avoid blunders.

Similar Wisdom:
 - Don't make perfect the enemy of the good.
 - Paralysis by analysis

*Ok, well Deep Blue kinda messed this up, but the point holds.*

##### Draw the Owl
> There are two steps in drawing an owl.
> First, you draw a circle for the head, and a circle for the body
> Then, you draw the fucking owl.

Origin: Startups

##### Disagree and Commit
Decisions are hard. We cannot be afraid to make bad choices, and someone
needs to make the call. We do not always need complete agreement, but we always
do need to support each other.

##### Alignment and Autonomy
Our management goal. Let's get on the same page, but you should "own" it from there.

##### #idea, #suggestion, #mandate
When dealing with a manager, sometimes it's confusing if you are being
instructed to do something or just talking.

Manager can clarify, you can ask for clarification.
Manager can clarify with:
 - #idea - I am just throwing this at the wall
 - #suggestion - My gut says you should do this, but you own it
 - #mandate -

##### 80/20 rule
We're a startup, we're not trying to make 100% solutions. E=MC^2

What: The Pareto Principle: 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort, the last 20% of the results take 80% of the effort.

##### Management Quadrants // Q1, Q2

How to prioritize what to do next
Q1 - urgent & important; do it fast, clear it out
Q2 - not-urgent & important; this is where the magic happens


| Not Urgent    | Urgent        |      |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-------------:|
| *Q2* Live Here | *Q1* Do this fast | **Important**     |
| Don't      | Delegate         | **Not Important** |

##### Sharpen the Axe
> "Give me 6 hours to cut down a tree, and I'll spend the first four sharpening the axe" - Abraham Lincoln

Long term thinking, planning.
Sometime it feels good to just start swinging, but it's important to remember
we're in this for the long haul.

## Some Quotes 

> "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together"

> "The best time to start was last year. Failing that, today will do."


## FraightChat

Here's some nonsense that's caught on:

##### 200
What: Short for "Ok, I got it."

Origin: 200 http response code = "success"
How:

##### Cycle
What: Short for "Cycle Request"
How:
```
You: "Cycle"
Them: "Queued - give me 5",  "What's up?", or "Denied"
```
Why: If someone is focused it, disruptions can really set them back. Even letting them know
what you want to talk about can break someone's "flow".
Origin: Processors.
