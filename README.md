# Welcome to the Fraight!

**⚠️ Warning! This document contains bugs. ⚠️**
Our goal is to foster a collaborative, creative, and safe culture that allows
everyone thrive. This handbook is our best attempt to facilitate that environment,
but we know there are missing features, and unintended consequences.

Just like our business and our product, we want this to be an iterative and collaborative process, and we encourage comments, issues, and change requests!

Feel free to send a PR or shoot either of us an email.

Cheers,

Parker and Zeke
