## 10. Safe Ride Home Policy

We want our team to remain safe and exercise caution when it comes to working late nights at the office and in situations where alcohol is involved. In the event that you are working at the office or at a scheduled work sponsored event until 9pm or later, please exercise our Safe Ride Home Policy. Fraight will reimburse transit expenses up to $25 (unless you are authorized to reimburse a larger amount). Also, please exercise this policy in the event that you have been drinking at a Fraight sponsored event.
