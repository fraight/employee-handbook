## 9. Performance

We actively measure employee performance at Fraight in order to ensure that everyone is meeting company standards. In events of sub-par performance, your direct supervisor will inform you and will work with you to provide the tools and training required to improve your performance. If you are still unable to meet expectations, you will receive a warning from your supervisor, which will be documented and filed with Human Resources and may include a written Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).

The PIP will specify measurable goals and timelines (determined by your direct supervisor) that must be met in order to continue your employment. You will have scheduled check-ins with your direct supervisor over the course of the PIP time period to track your progress and success. In the event that the goals outlined in the Performance Improvement Plan are not met, there may be cause for termination.

### 9.1 Annual Performance Reviews

At Fraight, we conduct an annual performance review and mid-year check in for all employees. These reviews consist of a self-review, manager review, followed by a 1:1 meeting between you and your direct supervisor to discuss feedback.
