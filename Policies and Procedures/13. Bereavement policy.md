## 13. Bereavement Policy

If someone you love passes away, you deserve some time away from work to process the loss, be with loved ones, and take care of yourself.

The first step is to talk to your manager, as soon as possible. They will coordinate any transfer of responsibilities that may be necessary.

In extremely rare circumstances, we may ask you to make small accommodations around business needs. But, we will do everything we can to support you around this tragedy.

Bereavement pay is calculated based on the base pay rate at the time of absence, and it will not include any special forms of compensation, such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, overtime or shift differentials.

Paid bereavement leave will be granted according to the following schedule:

Employees are allowed up to three consecutive days off from regularly scheduled duty with regular pay in the event of the death of the employeeâ€™s grandparent, spouse, child, father, father-in-law, mother, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother, sister, stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister, stepson or stepdaughter. To be eligible for paid bereavement leave, the employee generally must attend the funeral of the deceased relative.
