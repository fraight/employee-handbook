## 6. Job Abandonment

Employees who fail to report to work for three consecutive business days without notifying the company of the absence will be considered as having voluntarily resigned as a result of job abandonment.

If the employee is unable to contact Fraight for any absence, he or she should ask a representative (such as a family member or friend) to do so on the employeeâ€™s behalf. If the employee or a representative is unable to contact Fraight due to extreme circumstances (such as a medical emergency or natural disaster that prohibits the employee or his or her representative from contacting the Fraight within three days), the employee or his or her representative must contact Fraight as soon as practicable to explain the situation. In extreme circumstances, the employer will consider the explanation and its timing before determining if the voluntary resignation will be upheld.
