## 5. Harassment Policy

We have fun at Fraight and we love Fraight people...but we do not tolerate harassment or acting inappropriately toward any Fraight employee, whether you are on or off-site. Substantiated acts of harassment will be met with appropriate disciplinary action, including possible termination.

Fraight is committed to providing a workplace free of sexual harassment (which includes harassment based on gender, pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), as well as harassment based on such factors as race, color, creed, national origin, ancestry, age, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, sexual orientation, family care or medical leave status, veteran status, or any other status protected by federal or state laws. Fraight will not tolerate harassment of employees by managers, supervisors, or co-workers. Similarly, Fraight will not tolerate harassment by its employees or non-employees with whom the Fraight employees have a business, service, or professional relationship. Fraight also will attempt to protect employees from harassment by non-employees in the workplace.

Please let your Human Resources Department know as soon as possible if you believe you are the victim of harassment or if you witness harassment. Feel free to email people@fraight.com if you would like to remain anonymous. The Human Resources Department will investigate accordingly and take necessary measures up to and including termination pending the results of the investigation. You will be protected from any retaliatory actions in response to the results of that investigation.
