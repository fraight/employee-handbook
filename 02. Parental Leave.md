## 2. Parental Leave

Fraight recognizes the importance and need for new parents to take time off in order to care for a new child. As such, Fraight has developed the following policies in order to provide Fraight mothers and fathers needed time off.

This policy is for Exempt Full-Time Employees.

Fraight offers a robust parental leave policy to allow for bonding with a new child in the case of birth, foster child placement or adoption (any of these situations, an “Event”).

All of Fraight’s payments of salary during periods of Fraight time off under this Parental Leave policy shall be net of any payments that an employee is entitled to receive by reason of disability insurance and/or any applicable state disability benefits. It shall be the employee’s sole responsibility to file to receive such payments, and the above payments will continue to be net of any payments that an employee would have been entitled to receive by reason of disability insurance and/or applicable state disability benefits had such employee properly filed to receive such payments.

For employees who receive commission, you will still qualify for team win share and will receive monthly activity bonus.

Notice:

Employees should give notice to their manager as soon as possible to allow for planning to be done around a proposed leave and estimated date of leave. An employee must provide at least 30 days’ advance notice of an Event and commencement of Parental Leave. Please prepare for your leave and ensure that your responsibilities are covered while you are spending time with your new child.
