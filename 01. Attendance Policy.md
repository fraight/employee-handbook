# Fraight Employee Handbook

## 1. Attendance Policy


### 1.1 Vacation and Sick Time

- [x] Add 2 week minimum
- [x] Add to google calendar, invite with manager

Fraight has an "unlimited + 10" PTO (Fraight Time Off) policy, meaning we have no defined number of PTO days, but you MUST take 10 days. Yes, that’s right. We trust that you will take the time that you need, when you need it. You are free to take time off as you deem it necessary, consistent with the timely completion of both your personal and team responsibilities.

All PTO requests must be requested in advance by adding the days to your Google calendar & inviting your manager. The reason behind this is so we can keep track of the departments, who are and are not taking PTO, to ensure that our Unlimited PTO Policy is fair and being used by everyone.

If you’re sick and need to take time off let your manager know as soon as possible.  Should you ever leave Fraight, you are not entitled to any payment for unused PTO or vacation.

Fraight also provides leaves of absences for the following: (1) family care, medical, and military family leave; (2) pregnancy leave; (3) disability leave; (4) personal leave for compelling/urgent reasons; and (5) leave for other legally required absences (i.e. jury duty). Reach out to Human Resources should any of these situations arise.

Absences due to illnesses or injuries that qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) will not be counted against an employee’s attendance record. Medical documentation within the guidelines of the FMLA may be required in these instances.

While working remotely, employees must be responsive via email, phone and Slack for the entirety of the work day (9AM-5PM or 10AM-6PM) in accordance with their respective manager.
