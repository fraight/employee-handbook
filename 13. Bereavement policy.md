## 13. Bereavement Policy

An employee who wishes to take time off due to the death of an immediate family member should notify his or her supervisor immediately.

Bereavement leave will normally be granted unless there are unusual business needs or staffing requirements. An employee may, with his or her supervisor’s approval, use any available vacation for additional time off as necessary.

Bereavement pay is calculated based on the base pay rate at the time of absence, and it will not include any special forms of compensation, such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, overtime or shift differentials.

Paid bereavement leave will be granted according to the following schedule:

Employees are allowed up to three consecutive days off from regularly scheduled duty with regular pay in the event of the death of the employee’s grandparent, spouse, child, father, father-in-law, mother, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother, sister, stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister, stepson or stepdaughter. To be eligible for paid bereavement leave, the employee generally must attend the funeral of the deceased relative.
